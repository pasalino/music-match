# React Test

I'm creating this App for testing React.js.

This app is a initial challenge of [React JS and Redux - Mastering Web Apps](https://www.udemy.com/react-js-and-redux-mastering-web-apps/learn/v4/overview) course.

The App search a Misic Artist on Spotify, show his song and play it. For this, use a Spotify public API.
